# Deprecated

When I started this project I used this HTML file to build level for the game. But since then a lot changed (different names for tiles, tile size etc.) and I programmed a level builder inside the game. So I stopped working on this HTML file.

## Features

- export / import level
- build level
- change height and width (not needed because all level are 12x20)
